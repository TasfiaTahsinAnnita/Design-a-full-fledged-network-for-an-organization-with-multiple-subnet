## Overview
This project aims to design a scalable and secure network for an organization, accommodating various departments with different subnets. The network is structured to ensure efficient internal communication and external routing, with security features like VLANs and firewalls.

## Project Files
The repository contains the following files:
<br>
- MiniProject.pkt: A Cisco Packet Tracer simulation file containing the network configuration and simulation.
- design.png: A diagram illustrating the layout and architecture of the network.
- miniprojectreport.pdf: A detailed report explaining the network design, including the configurations, subnetting details, and security features.
- README.md: This documentation file, which provides instructions and details about the project.

## Requirements
To run the simulation, you need the following:
<br>
- Cisco Packet Tracer: A network simulation tool used to design, configure, and troubleshoot networks.
You can download Cisco Packet Tracer from Cisco's official website.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   
   ``bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-design-multiple-subnets.git
   ``
   
2. Open the MiniProject.pkt file using Cisco Packet Tracer.
3. Review the network design in the design.png image for an overview of the topology.

## Usage
- Open the MiniProject.pkt file in Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate and analyze the network design.
- Refer to the miniprojectreport.pdf for a detailed explanation of the design, including the rationale behind subnet configurations, security mechanisms, and performance considerations.
